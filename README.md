# Zoo-management
A zoo management system effectively manages and handles all the functioning of a zoo. The
software system can store the data of people tickets that came to visit in the zoo. The system
also maintains and calculates the price of ticket. The system needs an administrator to input
the detail of ticket like how many are adult and how many are child and print the ticket and
give it to person.

The project tries to accomplish all the following features:
â€¢ It helps the zoo admin to handle and manage ticket data.
Reduce time consumption.
Reduce error scope.
All system managements are automated.
Centralized database management.
Easy operations for operator of the system.
No paper work requirement.
